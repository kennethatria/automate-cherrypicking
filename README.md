AUTOMATE EVERYTHING with Go

Problem statment While cherry picking, I have issues finding the oldest commit and those that cause conflicts

This script helps find oldest commit and prints out possible conflicts incase of any

How to Use: 
  1. provide script with "file" and commit as arguments
  2. run Script with " go run main.go file commit-number"

additional feature prints log with date of script use.

Warning: I put a limit to how much this lines this script can read, which is 15
