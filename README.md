AUTOMATE EVERYTHING with Go

Problem statment While cherry picking, I have issues finding the oldest commit and those that cause conflicts

This script helps find oldest commit and prints out possible conflicts incase of any

How to Use: 
  1. provide script with commits as arguments
  2. run Script with " go run main.go"

additional feature prints log with date of script use.
